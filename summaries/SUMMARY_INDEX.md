# 📘 Principles of Building AI Agents (Second Edition)
### Summary Index

This folder contains detailed summaries of each part of **Sam Bhagwat’s book _Principles of Building AI Agents (2nd Edition)_**.  
Each file expands on the theory, architecture, and evolution of modern agent systems — bridging **reasoning, tools, memory, and orchestration**.

---

## 🧠 Part I – [Foundations and Prompting](./PART-01-Foundations-and-Prompting.md)
Introduces the core idea of agents as reasoning systems. Covers prompting strategies, structured outputs, and the four pillars: models, tools, memory, and workflows.

## ⚙️ Part II – [Agent Design and Core Patterns](./PART-02-Agent-Design-and-Core-Patterns.md)
Explains the internal design of agents: reasoning loops, tool use, memory management, and modular composition. Defines how agents think and act consistently.

## 🔌 Part III – [Tool Ecosystem and Protocols](./PART-03-Tool-Ecosystem-and-Protocols.md)
Focuses on tool integration, schema design, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Demonstrates safe, auditable communication between agents and their environments.

## 🔁 Part IV – [Workflow and Control Flow](./PART-04-Workflow-and-Control-Flow.md)
Explores orchestration, branching, parallelism, and human-in-the-loop execution. Introduces workflow graphs and serialization for pause/resume operations.

## 📚 Part V – [Retrieval and Knowledge Grounding](./PART-05-Retrieval-and-Knowledge-Grounding.md)
Details how agents use external data through RAG and Agentic RAG. Covers indexing, embeddings, and grounding reasoning in real-world facts.

## 🤝 Part VI – [Multi-Agent Orchestration](./PART-06-Multi-Agent-Orchestration.md)
Covers communication and coordination among multiple agents. Includes supervisor/worker, peer collaboration, and agent-as-tool architectures.

## 🧾 Part VII – [Evaluation and Quality Assurance](./PART-07-Evaluation-and-Quality-Assurance.md)
Introduces methods to test, measure, and visualize agent behavior. Discusses automated evals, human review, observability, and trace analysis.

## 🚀 Part VIII – [Deployment and Scaling](./PART-08-Deployment-and-Scaling.md)
Bridges experimentation and production. Covers reliability, monitoring, CI/CD integration, and infrastructure patterns for scaling agents.

## 🌌 Part IX – [Advanced and Future Directions](./PART-09-Advanced-and-Future-Directions.md)
Looks ahead to multimodal, self-improving, and ethically aligned agents. Explores new standards (MCP, A2A) and the future of agentic ecosystems.

### 💡 How to Use
1. Start from **Part I** and progress sequentially for a full conceptual foundation.  
2. Use the summaries alongside your code examples and experiments.  
3. Link each part to corresponding implementation files in your repo as you practice.
