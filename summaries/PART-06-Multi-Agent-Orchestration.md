# Part VI – Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Overview
Complex goals often require multiple agents collaborating. This part introduces architectures and communication models for cooperative systems.

## Patterns
- **Supervisor / Worker** – one agent plans; others execute.  
- **Peer Collaboration** – agents debate or negotiate to improve quality.  
- **Agent-as-Tool** – one agent can invoke another through a defined API.

## Communication
- Use structured messages (JSON, protocol buffers, etc.).  
- Include identity, purpose, and context.  
- Allow fallback or escalation when agents disagree.

## Synchronization
- Central coordinator vs distributed consensus.  
- Conflict resolution: voting, scoring, arbitration.

## Takeaway
Multi-agent systems represent the future of AI architecture — specialized entities cooperating under defined protocols.
