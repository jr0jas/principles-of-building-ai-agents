# Part IV – Workflow and Control Flow

## Overview
Agents rarely operate linearly. This part explores orchestration: how to manage branching, parallelism, pausing, and resuming.

## Workflow Graphs
- Represent processes as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  
- Nodes = steps or tools; edges = data or control flow.  
- Enables retries, partial recomputation, and modular design.

## Conditional Logic
- Agents can choose paths dynamically based on intermediate results.  
- Control flow integrates reasoning and logic (if/else, loops, priorities).

## Pause and Resume
- Supports human-in-the-loop checkpoints.  
- Serialize workflow state to disk or memory; restore later for continuity.

## Streaming
- Emit partial responses in real time for interactivity.  
- Combine partial reasoning with progressive refinement.

## Takeaway
Workflows turn agents into **process managers** — flexible systems that can pause, branch, retry, or delegate.
