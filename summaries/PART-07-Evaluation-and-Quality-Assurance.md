# Part VII – Evaluation and Quality Assurance

## Overview
Reliable agents require constant measurement. This part introduces methods for evaluation, regression testing, and observability.

## Evaluation Frameworks
- **Automated Evals** – rubric-based scoring for correctness and relevance.  
- **Human-in-the-loop** – expert judgment for subjective qualities.  
- **A/B Testing** – compare models or workflows using controlled experiments.

## Metrics
- Accuracy, factuality, relevance, robustness, latency, cost.  
- Behavioral metrics: success rate, tool selection accuracy.

## Observability & Tracing
- Log each reasoning step, prompt, and response.  
- Visualize traces to debug and optimize workflows.

## Takeaway
Evaluation is not optional — it’s the scientific backbone of agent reliability.
