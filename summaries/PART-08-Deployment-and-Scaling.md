# Part VIII – Deployment and Scaling

## Overview
This part bridges experimentation and production. It focuses on reliability, observability, and continuous delivery of agents at scale.

## Infrastructure
- Containerized or serverless deployment.  
- Secrets management, environment isolation, version control.  
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling.

## Reliability Patterns
- Retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, caching.  
- Canary releases and feature flags for new tools.

## Monitoring
- Latency tracking, error budgets, anomaly detection.  
- Distributed tracing across workflow components.

## Continuous Improvement
- Feedback loops from telemetry to model retraining or rule adjustment.  
- Automated tests and Evals in CI/CD pipelines.

## Takeaway
A successful agent is not just intelligent — it’s **operationally sound**, observable, and reproducible.
