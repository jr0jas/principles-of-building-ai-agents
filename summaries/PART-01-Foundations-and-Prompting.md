# Part I – Foundations and Prompting

## Overview
This part introduces the mindset and architecture behind agent design. It reframes AI agents not as chatbots, but as systems that **reason, plan, use tools, remember, and act**. It also explains the evolution from “prompt engineering” to “agent engineering”.

## Key Concepts
- **Definition of an Agent** – a system capable of perception, reasoning, and action within an environment.  
- **Spectrum of Autonomy** – from reactive assistants to strategic, self-directed systems.  
- **The Agent Loop** – plan → act → observe → reflect → adapt.  
- **The Four Pillars** – model, tools, memory, and control flow.

## Prompting Foundations
- Effective prompts create predictable, structured responses.  
- Use explicit schemas (JSON, YAML, or key-value pairs).  
- Avoid hidden assumptions; specify purpose, tone, and desired reasoning style.  
- Teach consistency through few-shot examples.

## Structured Outputs
- Define fixed fields or JSON schemas.  
- Validate output before use.  
- Enables automation and chaining between steps.

## Takeaway
Agents are the **logical evolution** of LLM apps — built not only on language understanding, but on **structured reasoning and interaction**.
