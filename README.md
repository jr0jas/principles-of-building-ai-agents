# Principles of Building AI Agents (Second Edition)

A repository designed to **apply and experiment with the core principles** from **Sam Bhagwat’s book _Principles of Building AI Agents (2nd Edition)_**.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is a **hands-on exploration** of the key frameworks and design patterns presented in the Second Edition of Sam Bhagwat’s *Principles of Building AI Agents*.  
Its goal is to transform the book’s theory into **practical, working examples** that demonstrate how modern agents can **reason, plan, use tools, remember, evaluate, and collaborate** effectively.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The repository evolves progressively, covering all major concepts introduced or expanded in the **Second Edition**, such as:

- **Core components of agents** – models, prompts, tools, and memory as modular building blocks.  
- **Prompting and structured outputs** – schema-based formats for consistency and reliability.  
- **Tool use and tool design** – safe, composable access to APIs, calculators, and external services.  
- **Memory systems** – from short-term scratchpads to vectorized and hierarchical memory.  
- **Planning and reasoning loops** – iterative decomposition, reflection, and self-correction.  
- **Workflows and control flow** – chaining, branching, and conditional orchestration.  
- **Pause/Resume and human-in-the-loop** – integrating checkpoints for mixed autonomy.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Agentic RAG** – grounding reasoning in real-world data.  
- **Model selection and routing** – balancing cost, latency, and accuracy dynamically.  
- **Guardrails and middleware** – enforcing safety, validation, and ethical behavior at runtime.  
- **Evaluation (Evals) and measurement** – performance tracking and behavioral benchmarking.  
- **Observability and tracing** – visualizing decision paths and tool interactions.  
- **Streaming and partial outputs** – enabling real-time, interactive reasoning.  
- **Multi-agent systems** – communication, supervision, and coordinated collaboration.  
- **MCP, web browsing, and computer use** – standardized interaction with external environments.  
- **Multimodality and code generation** – integrating language, vision, audio, and executable logic.  
- **Deployment and productization** – transitioning from prototypes to scalable, maintainable systems.

## 🧭 How to Use

Each section of the project aligns with a key concept or chapter from the **Second Edition**.  
You can explore and experiment step by step through topics such as:

1. **Basic agent loops** – plan → act → observe → adapt  
2. **Tool integration** – performing calculations, API calls, or information retrieval  
3. **Structured outputs and validation** – enforcing consistency and parseable results  
4. **Memory and retrieval strategies** – combining context with external knowledge  
5. **Evaluation and reflection** – measuring and refining agent behavior  
6. **Multi-agent orchestration** – enabling collaboration and coordination  

This progression helps transform theoretical understanding into **hands-on, verifiable implementation**.

## 💡 Goal

To bridge **theoretical principles and practical experimentation**, empowering developers, researchers, and learners to design, evaluate, and refine intelligent agents following the frameworks of the *Second Edition* of Sam Bhagwat’s book.
