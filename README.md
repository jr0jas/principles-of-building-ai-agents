# Principles of Building AI Agents (Second Edition)

A repository to put into practice the concepts from **Sam Bhagwatâ€™s book _Principles of Building AI Agents (2nd Edition)_**.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository is a hands-on exploration of the **core ideas and expanded frameworks introduced in the Second Edition** of Sam Bhagwatâ€™s *Principles of Building AI Agents*.  
It aims to transform the bookâ€™s theoretical principles into **practical, working examples**, showing how modern agents can **reason, plan, use tools, remember, evaluate, and collaborate**.

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The project evolves step by step, covering all major topics expanded in the **Second Edition**, including:

- **Core building blocks of agents** â€“ models, prompts, tools, and memory as modular components.  
- **Prompting & structured outputs** â€“ schema-based responses for reliable reasoning.  
- **Tool use & tool design** â€“ secure and composable access to calculators, APIs, and search.  
- **Memory systems** â€“ from short-term scratchpads to vector and hierarchical memory.  
- **Planning & reasoning loops** â€“ agents that decompose tasks and iterate through reflection.  
- **Workflows & control flow** â€“ chaining, branching, and conditional execution.  
- **Pause/Resume & human-in-the-loop** â€“ mixed autonomy with human checkpoints.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Agentic RAG** â€“ grounding through retrieval pipelines.  
- **Model selection & routing** â€“ balancing cost, latency, and accuracy with adaptive dispatch.  
- **Guardrails & middleware** â€“ enforcing safety and correctness at runtime.  
- **Evaluation (Evals)** and **measurement** â€“ automated performance tracking and benchmarks.  
- **Observability & tracing** â€“ monitoring agent decisions and tool interactions.  
- **Streaming & partial outputs** â€“ producing interactive, real-time reasoning flows.  
- **Multi-agent systems** â€“ coordination, supervision, and message passing among agents.  
- **MCP, web browsing & computer use** â€“ standardized access to external systems and environments.  
- **Multimodality & code generation** â€“ integrating language, vision, audio, and code reasoning.  
- **Deployment & productization** â€“ from prototype to reliable, maintainable agentic systems.

## ðŸ§­ How to Use

Each section corresponds to a principle or chapter in the **Second Edition** of the book.  
You can explore the examples sequentially, experimenting with:

1. **Simple agent loops** (plan â†’ act â†’ observe â†’ adapt)  
2. **Tool integration** (calculations, retrieval, or API calls)  
3. **Structured outputs and validation**  
4. **Memory and retrieval strategies**  
5. **Evaluation and reflection**  
6. **Multi-agent orchestration**  

This step-by-step progression helps bridge conceptual understanding with real-world implementation.

## ðŸ’¡ Goal

To connect **theoretical principles with practical experimentation**, empowering builders, researchers, and learners to design, evaluate, and evolve intelligent agents grounded in the frameworks of the *Second Edition* of Sam Bhagwatâ€™s book.
